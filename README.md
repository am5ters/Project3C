# Project3C

While trying to create the custom win and lost UI game states I realized that in order to even demonstrate the game states I needed a player character. Thus I pivoted to creating a package that would allow you to import a player character with full movement capabilities. 

I also solely use the remote access lab to do my ATEC work, so due to the power outages today I was unfortunately unable to finish the project by the deadline. I hope it's not too late.
